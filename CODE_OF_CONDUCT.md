# Repository's Code of Conduct

## Transperancy

Kernels that will be used for compilation here only allows for MizProject's kernel. This measure is taken to ensure that the kernel used is only the ones that MizProject works on

The kernel should be public-as-is and should no longer be restrictive, unlike the Previous v1 MizKernel works

## Timezone 

Timezone should only be set to GMT +8 Manila and should be directly etched to the kernel output, forbid any other timezone to be set.

## Forbid use of Third-party Hosts

Forbid the use of Hosting storage like SourceForge, but with exception on Archive.org for archiving

This is to ensure the authenticity of the Build is perfect as-is
